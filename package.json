We wanted to create an application that allows users to  filter through hikes that fit user criteria. Allowing users to select filters such as difficulty level, length of hike, family friendly, dog friendly makes hiking more accessible for those who have trouble finding hikes/ those who are new to hiking and donâ€™t know where to begin.",
